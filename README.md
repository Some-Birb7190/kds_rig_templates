# Notes about the digital rig  
  
`./5_bar_rig.qxw` is a template rig file for use with QLC+. It contains basic channel definitions as well as basic channel groups. It should **not** be modified directly and a copy should be created before a show's lighting is to be designed.  
  
The rig template uses a custom fixture pattern for the Gear4music Cosmos 90s, `./Gear4music-Cosmos-90.qxf`, and it should be distributed to every new user of the template. **Failure to do this will result in a broken workspace file!** Please see [this documentation](https://docs.qlcplus.org/v5/fixture-definition-editor) to ensure you put the fixture pattern in the right place.  
  
This fixture pattern only supports the basic RGBI (Red, Green, Blue, Intensity) input for the Cosmos 90s, the `mode` and `strobe` sliders are not assigned and will not be patched when adding the fixture to a workspace.  
As per the society's request, strobe lights are **not** permitted and this feature should **not** be added to the fixture pattern. Any modification of this fixture pattern should be authorized by the currently standing tech officer and checksums are to be edited to reflect the changes (checksums are provided at the bottom of this document).  
  
A source copy of this document can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Some-Birb7190/kds_rig_templates) via GitHub and should be forked as the society continues.
